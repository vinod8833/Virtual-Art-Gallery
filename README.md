React Flow & OpenAI API Integration

Overview

This project integrates React Flow for creating interactive workflows and utilizes the OpenAI API for LLM (Large Language Model) integration. The application allows users to create workflows with drag-and-drop functionality, while the backend is set up to integrate OpenAI's API to provide intelligent responses based on user input.

Tools Required
    Node.js and npm: For managing packages and running the React application.
    React: For building the user interface.
    React Flow: For creating the drag-and-drop workflow editor.
    OpenAI API: For generating intelligent responses using large language models.
    Express.js (Optional): For backend API calls if needed.
    Vercel/Netlify: For hosting the frontend.
    GitHub: For version control and sharing the repository.
